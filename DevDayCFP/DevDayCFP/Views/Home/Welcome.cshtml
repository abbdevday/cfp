        You can submit your <a href="/papers">session proposals</a> to DevDay 2015 on this site. We're looking for inspirational and informative talks on software development! You can take a look at previous editions of DevDay to get the feel of what we're searching for.

    For all <strong>accepted</strong> speakers we offer travel and accomodation if needed. We can't offer refunds for lightning talks though.

        Please note that this year we want to promote new speakers who have not spoken at DevDay before. For that reason we won't accept submissions from last years' speakers.
